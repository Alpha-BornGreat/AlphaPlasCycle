                <li><strong>Melting & Molding:</strong> The shredded plastic is melted down and reformed into new products, reducing the need for virgin plastic materials.</li>
                <li><strong>Distribution:</strong> The recycled plastic is then distributed to manufacturers to create new products, completing the recycling loop.</li>
